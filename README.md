# SNAKE IMPACT!!!
A simple Snake Game in C++

This is an implementation of the classic Snake game in C++. My first ever coding project. I will update this game from time to time.

## How to Play

- Use the following keys to control the snake:
  - `W` to move up
  - `S` to move down
  - `A` to move left
  - `D` to move right
  - `X` to quit the game

- Try to eat the pearls (`@`) to increase your score.
- Special bonuses (`$`) appear periodically. Collect them to earn extra points.
- The game ends when the snake runs into the wall or collides with itself.

## Features

- Randomly generated pearls and dynamic bonuses.
- Score tracking and tail length display.

## How to Run

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
2. Run the compiled executable.

## Dependencies

- This code uses the `<iostream>`, `<conio.h>`, `<Windows.h>`, `<string>`, `<fstream>`, and `<stdlib.h>` libraries.
- Note that `<conio.h>` and `<Windows.h>` are specific to Windows systems.

## Updates and Bug Fixes

# Snake Impact!!! v2.2.0 (9/14/2023)

Features

- Added pause game feature.
- Changed bonus character from static "$" to an updating set of numerical symbols, decrementing from 5 to 1 which also indicates the bonus multiplier depending on the symbol captured.
- Added Help and Settings menu.
- Added to change system's color in the Help and Settings menu.
- Added the option to switch Snakey's tail model while playing.
- Added an option to ping Google.com so we can preted that we're working (who knows this feature might give you promotion?).

Bugs

- Removed the random counter below the time and date row.
- Removed unecessary characters from the source code.
- Bonus now stays on the screen even if the pearl is eaten first (yes, it was a bug and was not a feature ðŸ¤£).

Gameplay Balancing

- Removed tail decrement bonus of 1-2 tails everytime the bonus is captured. Added +1 tail length instead.
- Now bonus only appears when tail is divisible by 7.
- Tail length decrement now only triggers when tail length is above or equal to 500 (1-2) and above or equal to 750 (1-3).

# Snake Impact!!! v2.1.0 (9/13/2023)
Features 

- Set maximum tail length to 999 just in case someone wants to set the world record in this game.
- Bonus now expires after some duration or when pearl is eaten first.
- Added main menu and a game speed selector (0 - 9) with score multiplier depending on the speed selected.

Bug Fixes

- Set bonus to trigger only when the tail length is greater than 2 to avoid tail decrement modulo operation by 0 which causes exception errors.
