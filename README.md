# SNAKE IMPACT!!!
A simple Snake Game in C++

This is an implementation of the classic Snake game in C++. My first ever coding project. I will update this game from time to time.

## How to Play

- Use the following keys to control the snake:
  - `W` to move up
  - `S` to move down
  - `A` to move left
  - `D` to move right
  - `X` to quit the game

- Try to eat the pearls (`@`) to increase your score.
- Special bonuses (`$`) appear periodically. Collect them to earn extra points.
- The game ends when the snake runs into the wall or collides with itself.

## Features

- Randomly generated pearls and dynamic bonuses.
- Score tracking and tail length display.

## How to Run

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
2. Run the compiled executable.

## Dependencies

- This code uses the `<iostream>`, `<conio.h>`, `<Windows.h>`, `<string>`, `<fstream>`, and `<stdlib.h>` libraries.
- Note that `<conio.h>` and `<Windows.h>` are specific to Windows systems.
